         President Buhari has reiterated the preparedness of the Federal Government to discuss the release of the Chibok girls kidnapped by Boko Haram terror group since 2014. In an interview with journalists in Nairobi, Kenya at the weekend, President Buhari said the Nigerian government is ready to dialogue with bonafide leaders of the terror group who know the whereabouts of the girls.
"I have made a couple of comments on the Chibok girls and it seems to me that much of it has been politicised. What we said is that the government which I preside over is prepared to talk to bonafide leaders of Boko Haram.

In an interview with NAN over the weekend, Abdullahi said;


“We discovered that many of them who are individuals with office are only interested in posing with IDPs going through hardship to access funds from donors. We discovered that some of them, currently occupying most of the big hotels in town, are only interested in defrauding their donors by sending fake data, messages and pictures via Internet so as to access fund. When we interrogated some of them, they said they just came into the town and were trying to figure out the problems to enable them bring in their intervention”he said

"I came here together with Alhaji Aliko Dangote. He doesn’t shack with microphones but his in quite tongues, his actions are more louder than his words. He is a hero of mine and so is your Governor.

"It is just a full time job taking care of this crisis mixing it with that basic job of government, I don't know how he does it but he does it so well. I have been to so many capitals of the world, I have been to Abuja, I have been Lagos, I have been Newyork, I have been London, I have been to Paris but I have never seen beautiful faces like yours. Your faces are so bright" Bono told the IDPs.
